                <section class="multicolumn">
                    <p>Let me introduce myself as {{name}}, this is one of my favorite names within the possibilities. I was born in 1986 halfway between Jaipur and Pushkar in the trunk of a Mercedes station wagon. My parents, hard on the late hippie trail at the time, met not too long before in Portugal. I was probably conceived in Essaouira, but maybe also in Imlil, my parents don't agree on that. When I was six, I was forgotten at my grandparents in Bologna. It was hot and dull so I left for Venice to become rich as a Gondolieri. I could not afford it so I visited my Aunt in the treehouse hotel. Years later, seventeen years old, I got bored and then ran off to Amsterdam. There I got lost and spent some time with the squatters at Bajesdorp. Best prison view included. I followed in my mother's footsteps on the Camden streets and stumbled through the dark tunnels of the Ligne de petite ceinture. I lived on the beach in Cabo de Gata and enjoyed my soy capucino in the backyards of Glasgow. Today I live withdrawn and deeply relaxing in the woods of Sm√•land and enjoy life like never before. Some time ago I stole a camera in Groningen and started taking photos. Spiritualized walk in the footsteps of my creators to find my nonexistent body.</p>

                        The colors of the world behave like those of the stones that you take out of cold clear water, disappearing slowly in front of your sadly disappointed eyes. Dried out, gray or sand. I wander through abandoned walls and scent the great wisdom of a glorious past, a unique smell. I am the prince and the princess on the back of an elephant right on the edge of the jungle where the monkeys scream in fear and exuberance. I call out to all of the warriors. Surrender, kneel down, accept your fate. Your story has been written many times. I sacrifice the mystic <a data-view="gallery" data-filter="Lost">Lost Series</a> to the gods of former times. The spirit animates the living and shapes the odd. My soul will vanish, my steps will stay. I'll live in causality till almost eternity. Slow stones, fast lives. Blink graceful for the sake of all summiteer. Slow down in woreship of your own confined age. A Persian taught me to be bored but I prefer to enjoy world and times in delightfull solitude far from any obligation. Truly seldom longed for the future.

                        On my travels I breathe the smell of the universe and eat the people's money. I immerse myself in the absence of culture. An animal spirit gave me a body. I am a proud animal on the hunt. The <a data-view="gallery" data-filter="Meander">Meander Series</a>. I am a donkey in the streets.

                        There is only beauty. I am aware of the ugliness, but I am blind to it and see nothing at all. My eyes deserve the miracles. I hunt them. My only striving, one compulsion. I have to note, I do not see you. I see almost nothing. I see the past. It's getting darker. There is only beauty. I will not tolerate anything else. I will force it. And then I don't see my hatred anymore. <a data-view="gallery" data-filter="Wayside">Wayside Series</a>

                        Flat and graphic, various layers stacked according to importance. Heaven one up. Inspired by wonders of photographic perspective distortion. Highly spiritual moments in Rajasthan, not to be visualize with a camera in front of either of my faces experiencing the moment.

                    <p>Since I, {{name}}, have several years of experience in the backyard internet scam business, I would like to share my knowledge and give you this well-behaved image viewer for free. If you're like me, you might benefit from it. I want everybody to be able to admire great photography without having to get a fucked up Insta account. I don't feel like reading shitty comments - a static page generator fits perfectly. Since everyone wants money from me, I don't feel like paying for the hosting and let Microsoft take care of it. Visit my <a href="https://github.com/emiolechi/photography">GitHub</a> for more information. Since Git and GitHub are ment to collaborate you can even work with your buddies on the same project out of the box.</p>
